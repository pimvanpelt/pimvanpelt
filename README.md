## About Pim van Pelt

My name is Pim van Pelt, born of Dutch parents in The Netherlands in July of 1976. On these pages, you can get to know me and the stuff I've done
in the past and plan to do in the future. This is actually version four of my homepage. For the older ones, I suggest you take a look at the
Internet Archive or my own history pages. They didn't amount to much (and to be honest, neither does this one) and all of their useful content
has been rolled up into the website you see in front of you today.

You can find me on <a rel="me" href="https://ublog.tech/@IPngNetworks">Mastodon</a> where I run a small server [uBlog.tech](https://ublog.tech).
I'm the founder/owner of [IPng Networks](https://ipng.ch), a small software company that develops free, open source routing software, that is
capable of forwarding >1Gpps and >1Tbps of traffic on commodity hardware.
